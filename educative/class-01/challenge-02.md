# Challenge 1: Big O of Nested Loop with Subtraction
Compute the Big O complexity of an algorithm which involves nested loops where the loop variable decrement with subtraction.

## Problem Statement
**Code Snippet**
```
n = 10
sum = 0
pie = 3.14

for var in range(n, 1, -3):
  print(pie):
  for j in range(n, 0, -1):
    sum += 1

print(sum)

```

### Solution Review:
The variable var gets set to n and then n - 3, n - (2 x 3), n - (3 x 3), ..., 3 in the outer lo

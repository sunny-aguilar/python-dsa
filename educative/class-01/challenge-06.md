# Challenge 6: Nested Loop with Multiplication
A more advanced exercise based on the Big O of an algorithm which involves nested loops and the loop variables increment with multiplication.

## Problem Statement
**Code Snippet**
```

n = 10  # can be anything
sum = 0
pie = 3.14

for i in range(n):
    j = 1
    while j < i:
        sum += 1
        j *= 2
    print(sum)

```

# Introduction to Lists
In this lesson, we define lists, how they are used in Python and how they are different from arrays.

In Python, a ***list*** is an ordered sequence of heterogeneous elements (can hold elements with different data types).

Example:
```
list = ['a', 'apple', 23, 3.14]
```

Lists can hold:
- integers
- strings
- characters
- functions
- any other data type including other lists

The elements can be accessed or ‘indexed’ using square brackets. The first element in a list is accessed using index 0 (as on line 7), the second element is accessed using 1, and so on.

## Important List Functions
These are some of the most useful built-in Python list functions.

### The ``` Append() ``` function
Use this function to add a single element to the end of a list. This functions works in O(1) constant time.

# Comparing Algorithms

## 1. Intro to Complexity Measures
How do we know which algorithm is better when we compare two algorithms that accomlish<br />
the same goal?

### Important Criteria: Time and Space
One important aspect that determines the "goodness" of an algorithm is the amount of time<br />
it takes to solve a given problem. Faster is better.<br />


## 2. Intro to Asymptotic Analysis and Big O

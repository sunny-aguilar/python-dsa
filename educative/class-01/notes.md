# Comparing Algorithms

## 1. Intro to Complexity Measures
How do we know which algorithm is better when we compare two algorithms that accomlish<br />
the same goal?

### Important Criteria: Time and Space
- One important aspect that determines the "goodness" of an algorithm is the amount of time<br />
it takes to solve a given problem. Faster is better.

Another aspect to consider is the amount of memory required to solve an algorithm. Less<br />
memory used is better.

The goals of an algorithm are:
- always correct
- always terminates

### How Do We Compare Execution Time?
One can always compare to algorithms by running them on a computer while measuring the execution<br />
time and the algorithm that finishes first will win. However, there are many issues with this<br />
approach:
- input size can have a large impact on execution time therefore both algorithms must be tested<br />
using the same input size
- the input given to both algorithms needs to be the same in order to prevent any disadvantages due<br />
to specific input

# Challenge 4: Nested Loop with Multiplication
A more complext exercise based on the Big O of an algorithm which involves nested loops and the loop variables increment with multiplication.

## Problem Statement
**Code Snippet**
```

n = 10  # can be anything, this is just an example
sum = 0
pie = 3.14

for var in range(1, n, 3):
    j = 1
    print(pie)
    while j < n:
        sum += 1
        j *= 3
print(sum)  # O(1)

```
